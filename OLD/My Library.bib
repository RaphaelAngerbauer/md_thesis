  abstract = {The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the cytosol and nucleus, and is implicated in many diseases. Here we describe a method for the rapid isolation of mammalian lysosomes and use it to quantitatively profile lysosomal metabolites under various cell states. Under nutrient replete conditions, many lysosomal amino acids are in rapid exchange with those in the cytosol. Loss of lysosomal acidification through inhibition of the vacuolar H+ATPase (VATPase) increased the luminal concentrations of most metabolites, but had no effect on those of the majority of essential amino acids. Instead, nutrient starvation regulates the lysosomal concentrations of these amino acids, an effect we traced to regulation of the mTOR pathway. Inhibition of mTOR strongly reduced the lysosomal efflux of most essential amino acids, converting the lysosome into a cellular depot for them. These results reveal the dynamic nature of lysosomal metabolites and that V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent mechanisms exist for controlling lysosomal amino acid efflux.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Progressive respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19. METHODS We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro\textendash computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. RESULTS In patients who died from Covid-19\textendash associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P{$<$}0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth \textemdash{} predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis \textemdash{} was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection. The universality and clinical implications of our observations require further research to define. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)},

  abstract = {Synucleins are abundant brain proteins, the physiological functions of which are poorly understood. The synuclein family consists of three members: {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}- and {$\gamma$}-synuclein. {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-synuclein are concentrated in nerve terminals, whereas {$\gamma$}-synuclein seems to be present throughout nerve cells. {$\alpha$}-synuclein is present in Lewy bodies, the main neuropathological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). This observation has led to the proposal that {$\alpha$}-synuclein might be involved directly in the pathogenic processes that underlie PD and several other diseases; the identification of {$\alpha$}-synuclein mutations leading to the appearance of genetic forms of PD in two different families has provided support for this idea. The presence of {$\alpha$}-synuclein in Lewy bodies has also been observed in other diseases, including dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. Other conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam and Hallervorden\textendash Spatz disease, can be accompanied by the formation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies; however, it is not an invariant feature of these diseases. The mechanism by which {$\alpha$}-synuclein accumulation leads to neurodegeneration is not completely understood. A leading hypothesis is that the ordered assembly of {$\alpha$}-synuclein into filaments, which seems to be induced by oxidative stress, is both necessary and sufficient to cause degeneration. However, alternative ideas have not been ruled out, and it is possible that oligomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein molecules are toxic.},

The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used\textemdash appropriately and less appropriately\textemdash to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.},

Direct transmission of alpha-synuclein from pathologically affected to healthy unaffected neurons may be important in the anatomical spread of the disease through the nervous system. We have demonstrated that exosomes released from alpha-synuclein over-expressing SH-SY5Y cells contained alpha-synuclein and these exosomes were capable of efficiently transferring alpha-synuclein protein to normal SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the incubation of cells with ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1 to produce the lysosomal dysfunction recently reported in Parkinson's disease led to an increase in the release of alpha-synuclein in exosomes and a concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein transmission to recipient cells. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of exosomes in both the release of alpha synuclein and its transmission between cells and suggests that factors associated with PD pathology accelerate this process. These mechanisms may play an important role in PD pathology and provide a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.},

Dominantly inherited mutations in {$\alpha$}-synuclein cause Parkinson's disease, but the physiological role of {$\alpha$}-synuclein remains unknown. Deletion of CSP{$\alpha$} produces rapidly progressive neurodegeneration in mice, presumably because the cochaperone function of CSP{$\alpha$} is essential for neuronal survival. Here, we report the surprising finding that transgenic expression of {$\alpha$}-synuclein abolishes the lethality and neurodegeneration caused by deletion of CSP{$\alpha$}. Conversely, ablation of endogenous synucleins exacerbates these phenotypes. Deletion of CSP{$\alpha$} inhibits SNARE complex assembly; transgenic {$\alpha$}-synuclein ameliorates this inhibition. In preventing neurodegeneration in CSP{$\alpha$}-deficient mice, {$\alpha$}-synuclein does not simply substitute for CSP{$\alpha$} but acts by a downstream mechanism that requires phospholipid binding by {$\alpha$}-synuclein. These observations reveal a powerful in vivo activity of {$\alpha$}-synuclein in protecting nerve terminals against injury and suggest that this activity operates in conjunction with CSP{$\alpha$} and SNARE proteins on the presynaptic membrane interface.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies, the major components of which are filaments consisting of {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Two recently identified point mutations in {$\alpha$}-synuclein are the only known genetic causes of PD. {$\alpha$}-Synuclein fibrils similar to the Lewy body filaments can be formedin vitro, and we have shown recently that both PD-linked mutations accelerate their formation. This study addresses the mechanism of {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation: we show that (i) it is a nucleation-dependent process that can be seeded by aggregated {$\alpha$}-synuclein functioning as nuclei, (ii) this fibril growth follows first-order kinetics with respect to {$\alpha$}-synuclein concentration, and (iii) mutant {$\alpha$}-synuclein can seed the aggregation of wild type {$\alpha$}-synuclein, which leads us to predict that the Lewy bodies of familial PD patients with {$\alpha$}-synuclein mutations will contain both, the mutant and the wild type protein. Finally (iv), we show that wild type and mutant forms of {$\alpha$}-synuclein do not differ in their critical concentrations. These results suggest that differences in aggregation kinetics of {$\alpha$}-synucleins cannot be explained by differences in solubility but are due to different nucleation rates. Consequently, {$\alpha$}-synuclein nucleation may be the rate-limiting step for the formation of Lewy body {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils in Parkinson's disease.},

Repeated release requires cycles of SNARE-complex assembly and disassembly, with continuous generation of reactive SNARE-protein intermediates. Although many forms of neurodegeneration initiate presynaptically, only few pathogenic mechanisms are known, and the functions of presynaptic proteins linked to neurodegeneration, such as {$\alpha$}-synuclein, remain unclear. Here, we find that maintenance of continuous presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly required a non-classical chaperone activity mediated by synucleins. Specifically, {$\alpha$}-synuclein directly bound to the SNARE-protein synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2, and promoted SNARE-complex assembly. Moreover, triple knockout mice lacking synucleins developed age-dependent neurological impairments, exhibited decreased SNARE-complex assembly, and perished prematurely. Thus, synucleins may function to sustain normal SNARE-complex assembly in a presynaptic terminal during aging.},

  abstract = {There is much interest in delineating the mechanisms by which the {$\alpha$}-synuclein protein accumulates in brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Preclinical studies with rodent and primate models have indicated that fibrillar forms of {$\alpha$}-synuclein can initiate the propagation of endogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein pathology. However, the underlying mechanisms by which {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils seed pathology remain unclear. To investigate this further, we have used exogenous fibrillar {$\alpha$}-synuclein to seed endogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein pathology in human neuronal cell lines, including primary human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. Fluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses were used to monitor levels of {$\alpha$}-synuclein and key autophagy/lysosomal proteins over time in the exogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibril-treated neurons. We observed that temporal changes in the accumulation of cytoplasmic {$\alpha$}-synuclein inclusions were associated with changes in the key autophagy/lysosomal markers. Of note, chloroquine-mediated blockade of autophagy increased accumulation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein inclusions, and rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy, or use of 5{${'}$}-AMP\textendash activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists, promoted the clearance of fibril-mediated {$\alpha$}-synuclein pathology. These results suggest a key role for autophagy in clearing fibrillar {$\alpha$}-synuclein pathologies in human neuronal cells. We propose that our findings may help inform the development of human neural cell models for screening of potential therapeutic compounds for PD or for providing insight into the mechanisms of {$\alpha$}-synuclein propagation. Our results further add to existing evidence that AMPK activation may be a therapeutic option for managing PD.},

SCWs specifically reported uncertainties around how to access COVID-19 vaccination. Participants who indicated stronger agreement with the statement               `I would recommend my organisation as a place to work'               were more likely to have been offered COVID-19 vaccination (OR:1.28, 95\%CI: 1.06 \textendash{} 1.56). Those who agreed more strongly with the statement `               I feel/felt under pressure from my employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine               ' were more likely to have declined vaccination (OR:1.75, 95\%CI: 1.27\textendash{} 2.41). Interviewees that experienced employer pressure to get vaccinated felt this exacerbated their vaccine concerns and increased distrust.                          In comparison to White British and White Irish participants, Black African and Mixed Black African participants were more likely to not be offered (OR:2.011, 95\%CI: 1.026 \textendash{} 3.943) and more likely to have declined COVID-19 vaccination (OR:5.55, 95\%CI: 2.29 \textendash{} 13.43). Reasons for declining vaccination among Black African participants included distrust in COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare providers, and policymakers.                                   Conclusion             H\&SCW employers are in a pivotal position to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination access, by ensuring staff are aware of how to get vaccinated and promoting a workplace environment in which vaccination decisions are informed and voluntary.},

We propose that physical clustering of autophagy receptor proteins on the organelle surface can provide an appropriate all-or-none signal for organelle degradation. We explore this proposal using a computational model restricted to peroxisomes and the relatively well characterized pexophagy receptor proteins NBR1 and p62. We find that larger peroxisomes nucleate NBR1 clusters first and lose them last through competitive coarsening. This results in significant size-selectivity that favors large peroxisomes, and can explain the increased catalase signal that results from siRNA inhibition of p62. Excess ubiquitin, resulting from damaged organelles, suppresses size-selectivity but not cluster formation. Our proposed selectivity mechanism thus allows all damaged organelles to be degraded, while otherwise selecting only a portion of organelles for degradation.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, high-throughput microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze cellular dynamics in an unprecedentedly high resolved manner. The amount of data that is generated, for example in longterm time-lapse microscopy experiments, requires automated methods for processing and analysis. Available software frameworks are well suited for high-throughput processing of fluorescence images, but they often do not perform well on bright field image data that varies considerably between laboratories, setups, and even single experiments. Results: In this contribution, we present a fully automated image processing pipeline that is able to robustly segment and analyze cells with ellipsoid morphology from bright field microscopy in a high-throughput, yet time efficient manner. The pipeline comprises two steps: (i) Image acquisition is adjusted to obtain optimal bright field image quality for automatic processing. (ii) A concatenation of fast performing image processing algorithms robustly identifies single cells in each image. We applied the method to a time-lapse movie consisting of {$\sim$}315,000 images of differentiating hematopoietic stem cells over 6 days. We evaluated the accuracy of our method by comparing the number of identified cells with manual counts. Our method is able to segment images with varying cell density and different cell types without parameter adjustment and clearly outperforms a standard approach. By computing population doubling times, we were able to identify three growth phases in the stem cell population throughout the whole movie, and validated our result with cell cycle times from single cell tracking. Conclusions: Our method allows fully automated processing and analysis of high-throughput bright field microscopy data. The robustness of cell detection and fast computation time will support the analysis of high-content screening experiments, on-line analysis of time-lapse experiments as well as development of methods to automatically track single-cell genealogies.},

We identify a conformational change from the initially formed oligomers to stable, more compact proteinase-K-resistant oligomers as the key step that leads ultimately to fibril formation. The oligomers formed as a result of the structural conversion generate much higher levels of oxidative stress in rat primary neurons than do the oligomers formed initially, showing that they are more damaging to cells. The structural conversion is remarkably slow, indicating a high kinetic barrier for the conversion and suggesting that there is a significant period of time for the cellular protective machinery to operate and potentially for therapeutic intervention, prior to the onset of cellular damage. In the absence of added soluble protein, the assembly process is reversed and fibrils disaggregate to form stable oligomers, hence acting as a source of cytotoxic species.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation into such filamentous inclusions remain unknown. An intriguing aspect of this problem is that {$\alpha$}-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein, with little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions. This raises the question of how an essentially disordered protein is transformed into highly organized fibrils. In the search for an answer to this question, we have investigated the effects of pH and temperature on the structural properties and fibrillation kinetics of human recombinant {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Either a decrease in pH or an increase in temperature transformed {$\alpha$}-synuclein into a partially folded conformation. The presence of this intermediate is strongly correlated with the enhanced formation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils. We propose a model for the fibrillation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein in which the first step is the conformational transformation of the natively unfolded protein into the aggregation-competent partially folded intermediate.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Methods: Between the 10th and the 23rd of May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a representative sample of the French population aged 18 and over participants. Results: Among 3,056 respondents, 1,314 (43.0 \%) were in favor of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination, 1,281 (41.9 \%) were opposed to such a policy, and 461 (15.1 \%) were undecided. Among opponents to COVID-19 mandatory vaccination for the general population, 385 (30.05 \%) were in favor of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers. Younger individuals, individuals with little fear of getting infected, no intention of getting vaccinated, lack of trust in the government, and respondents who felt close to the green party or the far left were associated with opposition to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. Conclusion: Attitudes toward mandatory COVID-19 vaccination are split in the French general population, and the debate might be politicized.},

  abstract = {The two main pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease are loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and proteinaceous amyloid fibrils composed mostly of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, called Lewy pathology. Levodopa to enhance dopaminergic transmission remains one of the most effective treatment for alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (Olanow, Mov Disord 34:812\textendash 815, 2019). In addition, deep brain stimulation (Bronstein et al., Arch Neurol 68:165, 2011) to modulate basal ganglia circuit activity successfully alleviates some motor symptoms. MRI guided focused ultrasound in the subthalamic nucleus is a promising therapeutic strategy as well (Martinez-Fernandez et al., Lancet Neurol 17:54\textendash 63, 2018). However, to date, there exists no treatment that stops the progression of this disease. The findings that {$\alpha$}-synuclein can be released from neurons and inherited through interconnected neural networks opened the door for discovering novel treatment strategies to prevent the formation and spread of Lewy pathology with the goal of halting PD in its tracks. This hypothesis is based on discoveries that pathologic aggregates of {$\alpha$}-synuclein induce the endogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein protein to adopt a similar pathologic conformation, and is thus self-propagating. Phase I clinical trials are currently ongoing to test treatments such as immunotherapy to prevent the neuron to neuron spread of extracellular aggregates. Although tremendous progress has been made in understanding how Lewy pathology forms and spreads throughout the brain, cell intrinsic factors also play a critical role in the formation of pathologic {$\alpha$}-synuclein, such as mechanisms that increase endogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein levels, selective expression profiles in distinct neuron subtypes, mutations and altered function of proteins involved in {$\alpha$}-synuclein synthesis and degradation, and oxidative stress. Strategies that prevent the formation of pathologic {$\alpha$}-synuclein should consider extracellular release and propagation, as well as neuron intrinsic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that results when the heart is unable to provide sufficient blood flow to meet metabolic requirements or accommodate systemic venous return. This common condition affects over 5 million people in the United States at a cost of \$10\textendash 38 billion per year. Heart failure results from injury to the myocardium from a variety of causes including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Less common etiologies include cardiomyopathies, valvular disease, myocarditis, infections, systemic toxins, and cardiotoxic drugs. As the heart fails, patients develop symptoms which include dyspnea from pulmonary congestion, and peripheral edema and ascites from impaired venous return. Constitutional symptoms such as nausea, lack of appetite, and fatigue are also common. There are several compensatory mechanisms that occur as the failing heart attempts to maintain adequate function. These include increasing cardiac output via the Frank\textendash Starling mechanism, increasing ventricular volume and wall thickness through ventricular remodeling, and maintaining tissue perfusion with augmented mean arterial pressure through activation of neurohormonal systems. Although initially beneficial in the early stages of heart failure, all of these compensatory mechanisms eventually lead to a vicious cycle of worsening heart failure. Treatment strategies have been developed based upon the understanding of these compensatory mechanisms. Medical therapy includes diuresis, suppression of the overactive neurohormonal systems, and augmentation of contractility. Surgical options include ventricular resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular remodeling, ventricular assist device implantation, and heart transplantation. Despite significant understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in heart failure, this disease causes significant morbidity and carries a 50\% 5-year mortality. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {{$\alpha$}-Synuclein ({$\alpha$}-syn) is a hallmark amyloidogenic protein component of Lewy bodies in dopaminergic neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the multi-faceted gene regulation of {$\alpha$}-syn in the nucleus, the mechanism underlying {$\alpha$}-syn crosstalk in chromatin remodeling in PD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identified transcriptional adapter 2-alpha (TADA2a) as a novel binding partner of {$\alpha$}-syn using the BioID system. TADA2a is a component of the p300/CBP-associated factor and is related to histone H3/H4 acetylation. We found that {$\alpha$}-syn A53T was more preferentially localized in the nucleus than the {$\alpha$}-syn wild-type (WT), leading to a stronger disturbance of TADA2a. Indeed, {$\alpha$}-syn A53T significantly reduced the level of histone H3 acetylation in SH-SY5Y cells; its reduction was also evident in the striatum (STR) and substantia nigra (SN) of mice that were stereotaxically injected with {$\alpha$}-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Interestingly, {$\alpha$}-syn PFF injection resulted in a decrease in TADA2a in the STR and SN of {$\alpha$}-syn PFF-injected mice. Furthermore, the levels of TADA2a and acetylated histone H3 were significantly decreased in the SN of patients with PD. Therefore, histone modification through {$\alpha$}-syn A53T-TADA2a interaction may be associated with {$\alpha$}-syn-mediated neurotoxicity in PD pathology.},

We hypothesized that compounds that interact with both the autophagosome protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)1 and the disease-causing protein may target the latter for autophagic clearance. Mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) contains an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and causes Huntington's disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder2. Here, using small-molecule-microarray-based screening, we identified four compounds that interact with both LC3 and mHTT, but not with~the wild-type HTT protein. Some of these compounds targeted mHTT to autophagosomes, reduced mHTT levels in an allele-selective manner, and rescued disease-relevant phenotypes in cells and in vivo in fly and mouse models of Huntington's disease. We further show that these compounds interact with the expanded polyQ stretch and could lower the level of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3), another disease-causing protein with an expanded polyQ tract3. This study presents candidate compounds for lowering mHTT and potentially other disease-causing proteins with polyQ expansions, demonstrating the concept of lowering levels of disease-causing proteins using autophagosome-tethering compounds.},

  abstract = {Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies.},

  abstract = {Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved transport pathway where targeted structures are sequestered by phagophores, which mature into autophagosomes, and then delivered into lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases and its modulation is beneficial for the outcome of numerous specific diseases. Several lysosomal inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), protease inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ), have been used interchangeably to block autophagy in in vitro experiments assuming that they all primarily block lysosomal degradation. Among them, only CQ and its derivate hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are FDA-approved drugs and are thus currently the principal compounds used in clinical trials aimed to treat tumors through autophagy inhibition. However, the precise mechanism of how CQ blocks autophagy remains to be firmly demonstrated. In this study, we focus on how CQ inhibits autophagy and directly compare its effects to those of BafA1. We show that CQ mainly inhibits autophagy by impairing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes rather than by affecting the acidity and/or degradative activity of this organelle. Furthermore, CQ induces an autophagy-independent severe disorganization of the Golgi and endo-lysosomal systems, which might contribute to the fusion impairment. Strikingly, HCQ-treated mice also show a Golgi disorganization in kidney and intestinal tissues. Altogether, our data reveal that CQ and HCQ are not bona fide surrogates for other types of late stage lysosomal inhibitors for in vivo experiments. Moreover, the multiple cellular alterations caused by CQ and HCQ call for caution when interpreting results obtained by blocking autophagy with this drug.},

Design\hspace{0.6em} Rapid systematic review and meta-\-analysis of observational research. Setting\hspace{0.6em} International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants\hspace{0.6em} Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-\-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-\-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-\-analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures\hspace{0.6em} Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. Results\hspace{0.6em} The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95\% CIs) of 1.63 (95\% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95\% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95\% CIs) was 5.8 (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95\% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95\% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95\% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.},

Both the N- and C-terminal regions of {$\alpha$}-synuclein are tightly associated with membranes. A weak interaction also occurs between the N and C termini themselves. The Parkinson's disease-associated mutations have no effect on membrane interaction; however, the Ala-30 \textrightarrow{} Pro mutation alters the three-dimensional conformation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, as measured by significantly increased fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the N and C termini.},

  abstract = {Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is now widely used to monitor autophagy. One approach is to detect LC3 conversion (LC3-I to LC3-II) by immunoblot analysis because the amount of LC3-II is clearly correlated with the number of autopha-gosomes. However, LC3-II itself is degraded by autophagy, making interpretation of the results of LC3 immunoblotting problematic. Furthermore, the amount of LC3 at a certain time point does not indicate autophagic flux, and therefore, it is important to measure the amount of LC3-II delivered to lysosomes by comparing LC3-II levels in the presence and absence of lysosomal protease inhibitors. Another problem with this method is that LC3-II tends to be much more sensitive to be detected by immunoblotting than LC3-I. Accordingly, simple comparison of LC3-I and LC3-II, or summation of LC3-I and LC3-II for ratio determinations, may not be appropriate, and rather, the amount of LC3-II can be compared between samples.},

It has been proposed that some of these symptoms might be related to the widespread pathology of {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}-syn) aggregation in different nuclei of the central and peripheral nervous system. However, the pathogenic formation of {$\alpha$}-syn aggregates in different brain areas of PD patients is poorly understood. Most experimental models of PD are valuable to assess specific aspects of its pathogenesis, such as toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, new models are required that reflect the widespread and progressive formation of {$\alpha$}-syn aggregates in different brain areas. Such {$\alpha$}-syn aggregation is induced in only a few animal models, for example perikaryon inclusions are found in rats administered rotenone, aggregates with a neuritic morphology develop in mice overexpressing either mutated or wild-type {$\alpha$}-syn, and in Smad3 deficient mice, aggregates form extensively in the perikaryon and neurites of specific brain nuclei. In this review we focus on {$\alpha$}-syn aggregation in the human disorder, its genetics and the availability of experimental models. Indeed, evidences show that dopamine (DA) metabolism may be related to {$\alpha$}-syn and its conformational plasticity, suggesting an interesting link between the two pathological hallmarks of PD: dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy body (LB) formation.},

  abstract = {Background: Global vaccine development efforts have been accelerated in response to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US). Methods: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 95\% against disease following 2 doses administered 21 days apart achieving 40\% vaccine coverage of the overall population within 284 days. We varied vaccine efficacy against infection, and specified 10\% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario. The model was calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.2, accounting for current non-pharmaceutical interventions in the US. Results: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 4.6\% (95\% CrI: 4.3\% - 5.0\%) from 9.0\% (95\% CrI: 8.4\% - 9.4\%) without vaccination, over 300 days. The highest relative reduction (5462\%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 63.5\% (95\% CrI: 60.3\% - 66.7\%), 65.6\% (95\% CrI: 62.2\% - 68.6\%), and 69.3\% (95\% CrI: 65.5\% - 73.1\%), respectively, across the same period. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks, even with limited protection against infection. However, continued compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions is essential to achieve this impact.},

  abstract = {The ``non-A{$\beta$} component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque'' (NAC) is a minor peptide component of the insoluble fibrillar core of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuritic plaque. NAC amyloid fibrils seed the polymerization of A{$\beta$}1-40, the major AD amyloid protein. NAC is derived from a 14 kDa precursor protein, designated NACP, a member of a highly conserved family of heat-stable brainspecific acidic proteins which have been suggested to be involved in synapse formation and/or stabilization. NACP has also been suggested to play a role in AD. We present herein a conformational analysis of human NACP. NACP has a much larger Stokes radius (34 \AA ) but sedimented more slowly (s20,w ) 1.7S) than globular proteins of similar molecular weight, indicating that the native protein is elongated. Circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicate the absence of significant amounts of secondary structure in NACP, while CD and ultraviolet spectroscopy suggest the lack of a hydrophobic core. The conformational properties of NACP were unchanged by boiling and were independent of concentration, pH, salt, and chemical denaturants. These features indicate that NACP exists as a mixture of rapidly equilibrating extended conformers and is representative of a class of ``natively unfolded'' proteins, many of which potentiate protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, an abundant and conserved pre-synaptic brain protein, is implicated as a critical factor in several neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases, known as synucleinopathies, include Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (LBs), diffuse LB disease, the LB variant of Alzheimer's disease, multiple system atrophy, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type I. Although the precise nature of in vivo{$\alpha$}-synuclein function remains elusive, considerable knowledge has been accumulated about its structural properties and conformational behavior. {$\alpha$}-Synuclein is a typical natively unfolded protein. It is characterized by the lack of rigid, well-defined, 3-D structure and possesses remarkable conformational plasticity. The structure of this protein depends dramatically on its environment and it accommodates a number of unrelated conformations. This paper provides an overview of the biochemistry, biophysics, and neuropathology of {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation.},

  abstract = {In response to intracellular stress events ranging from starvation to pathogen invasion, the cell activates one or more forms of macroautophagy. The key event in these related pathways is the de novo formation of a new organelle called the autophagosome, which either surrounds and sequesters random portions of the cytoplasm or selectively targets individual intracellular challenges. Thus, the autophagosome is a flexible membrane platform with dimensions that ultimately depend upon the target cargo. The intermediate membrane, termed the phagophore or isolation membrane, is a cup-like structure with a clear concave face and a highly curved rim. The phagophore is largely devoid of integral membrane proteins; thus, its shape and size are governed by peripherally associated membrane proteins and possibly by the lipid composition of the membrane itself. Growth along the phagophore rim marks the progress of both organelle expansion and ultimately organelle closure around a particular cargo. These two properties, a reliance on peripheral membrane proteins and a structurally distinct membrane architecture, suggest that the ability to target or manipulate membrane curvature might be an essential activity of proteins functioning in this pathway. In this review, we discuss the extent to which membranes are naturally curved at each of the cellular sites believed to engage in autophagosome formation, review basic mechanisms used to sense this curvature, and then summarize the existing literature concerning which autophagy proteins are capable of curvature recognition. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the degradation of cytoplasmic organelles, proteins, and macromolecules, and the recycling of the breakdown products, autophagy plays important roles in cell survival and maintenance. Accordingly, dysfunction of this process contributes to the pathologies of many human diseases. Recent Advances: Extensive research is currently being done to better understand the process of autophagy. In this review, we describe current knowledge of the morphology, molecular mechanism, and regulation of mammalian autophagy. Critical Issues: At the mechanistic and regulatory levels, there are still many unanswered questions and points of confusion that have yet to be resolved. Future Directions: Through further research, a more complete and accurate picture of the molecular mechanism and regulation of autophagy will not only strengthen our understanding of this significant cellular process, but will aid in the development of new treatments for human diseases in which autophagy is not functioning properly.

Confocal laser microscopy analysis revealed that anti-NACP immunostaining was colocalized with synaptophysin-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals. Ultrastructural analysis showed that NACP immunoreactivity was associated with synaptic vesicles. NACP sequence showed 95\% identity with that of rat synuclein 1, a synaptic/nuclear protein previously identified in rat brain, and good homology with Torpedo synuclein from the electric organ synapse and bovine phosphoneuroprotein 14 (PNP-14), a brain-specific protein present in synapses.

Although it is widely believed that {$\alpha$}-syn plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD, the processes that govern {$\alpha$}-syn fibrillization and LB formation remain poorly understood. In this work, we sought to dissect the spatiotemporal events involved in the biogenesis of the LBs at the genetic, molecular, biochemical, structural, and cellular levels. Toward this goal, we further developed a seeding-based model of {$\alpha$}-syn fibrillization to generate a neuronal model that reproduces the key events leading to LB formation, including seeding, fibrillization, and the formation of inclusions that recapitulate many of the biochemical, structural, and organizational features of bona fide LBs. Using an integrative omics, biochemical and imaging approach, we dissected the molecular events associated with the different stages of LB formation and their contribution to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In addition, we demonstrate that LB formation involves a complex interplay between {$\alpha$}-syn fibrillization, posttranslational modifications, and interactions between {$\alpha$}-syn aggregates and membranous organelles, including mitochondria, the autophagosome, and endolysosome. Finally, we show that the process of LB formation, rather than simply fibril formation, is one of the major drivers of neurodegeneration through disruption of cellular functions and inducing mitochondria damage and deficits, and synaptic dysfunctions. We believe that this model represents a powerful platform to further investigate the mechanisms of LB formation and clearance and to screen and evaluate therapeutics targeting {$\alpha$}-syn aggregation and LB formation.},

As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the current position of social media platforms in propagating vaccine hesitancy and explore next steps in how social media may be used to improve health literacy and foster public trust in vaccination.},

Uptake of PFFs is disrupted by macropinocytic inhibitors and circumvents classical endosomal pathways. Immunogoldlabeled PFFs are seen at the highly curved inward edge of membrane ruffles, in newly formed macropinosomes, in multivesicular bodies and in lysosomes. While most fibrils remain in lysosomes, a portion is transferred to neighboring naive cells along with markers of exosomes. These data indicate that PFFs use a unique internalization mechanism as a component of cell-to-cell propagation.},

Two decades of intensive research have compiled a massive body of evidence that aggregation of {$\alpha$}-syn is a critical process in PD and other synucleinopathies. The dissemination of Lewy body pathology throughout the central nervous system strongly suggests a cell-to-cell transmission of {$\alpha$}-syn. Although in vitro and in vivo evidence has convincingly demonstrated that aggregation-prone {$\alpha$}-syn can spread from cell to cell, the exact mechanisms and the role for the disease pathology remain elusive. Except for cases of direct contact, the transmission of {$\alpha$}-syn from cell to cell requires that {$\alpha$}-syn is released to the extracellular space and taken up by recipient cells. Furthermore, internalized {$\alpha$}-syn needs to gain access to the cytoplasm and/or target organelles of the recipient cell.

The purpose of deconvolution microscopy is to compensate numerically for this degradation. Deconvolution is widely used to restore fine details of 3D biological samples. Unfortunately, dealing with deconvolution tools is not straightforward. Among others, end users have to select the appropriate algorithm, calibration and parametrization, while potentially facing demanding computational tasks. To make deconvolution more accessible, we have developed a practical platform for deconvolution microscopy called DeconvolutionLab. Freely distributed, DeconvolutionLab hosts standard algorithms for 3D microscopy deconvolution and drives them through a user-oriented interface. In this paper, we take advantage of the release of DeconvolutionLab2 to provide a complete description of the software package and its built-in deconvolution algorithms. We examine several standard algorithms used in deconvolution microscopy, notably: Regularized inverse filter, Tikhonov regularization, Landweber, Tikhonov\textendash Miller, Richardson\textendash Lucy, and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding. We evaluate these methods over large 3D microscopy images using simulated datasets and real experimental images. We distinguish the algorithms in terms of image quality, performance, usability and computational requirements. Our presentation is completed with a discussion of recent trends in deconvolution, inspired by the results of the Grand Challenge on deconvolution microscopy that was recently organized.},

  abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that is mediated by de novo formation of autophagosomes. Autophagosome formation involves dynamic morphological changes; a disk-shaped membrane cisterna grows, bends to become a cup-shaped structure, and finally develops into a spherical autophagosome. We have constructed a theoretical model that integrates the membrane morphological change and entropic partitioning of putative curvature generators, which we have used to investigate the autophagosome formation process quantitatively. We show that the membrane curvature and the distribution of the curvature generators stabilize disk- and cup-shaped intermediate structures during autophagosome formation, which is quantitatively consistent with in vivo observations. These results suggest that various autophagy proteins with membrane curvature-sensing properties control morphological change by stabilizing these intermediate structures. Our model provides a framework for understanding autophagosome formation.},

These improvements have enabled earlier and more precise diagnosis, assessment of the proper timing of surgical and interventional procedures, improved prosthetic and biologic valve replacements and repairs, recognition of postoperative complications and their management, and the introduction of minimally invasive approaches that have enabled definitive and durable treatment for patients who were previously considered inoperable. This review summarizes the current state of our understanding of the mechanisms of heart valve health and disease arrived at through innovative research on the cell and molecular biology of valves, clinical and pathological features of the most frequent intrinsic structural diseases that affect the valves, and the status and pathological considerations in the technological advances in valvular surgery and interventions.

TMEM192 does not exhibit any significant  homology to known protein families and possesses four potential transmembrane  segments. To approach the molecular role of TMEM192, a detailed biochemical  characterisation of this protein was performed. Expression constructs of fusion  proteins containing TMEM192 and appended epitope tags were constructed. In HeLa  cells these proteins were detected in membranes of lysosomes/late endosomes. To  examine endogenous TMEM192, a TMEM192-specific antibody was generated and  validated. With this antibody colocalisation of endogenous TMEM192 with lysosomal  and late endosomal markers was demonstrated. Using Percoll density gradient  centrifugation and immunoblotting, co-sedimentation of major portions of both  TMEM192 and the lysosomal proteins LAMP-2 and cathepsin D into high-density  fractions was observed. Interestingly, in contrast to many other lysosomal  proteins no N-glycosylation of TMEM192 could be detected. Western blotting of  reduced and non-reduced samples and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated  TMEM192 to be a homodimer with one or more interchain disulphide bridges. TMEM192  was found to be strongly expressed in human kidney, liver, lung and pancreas  tissue. The widespread tissue distribution could suggest an important role of  TMEM192 for lysosomal function.},

Here we develop a novel computational imaging technology for the simultaneous evaluation of eight distinct markers, allowing for spatial analysis of distinct populations within the same section. We report a heterogeneous population of infiltrating T lymphocytes. Spatial distribution of cytotoxic T cells in proximity to cancer cells correlates with increased overall patient survival. Collagen-I and {$\alpha$}SMA+ fibroblasts do not correlate with paucity in T-cell accumulation, suggesting that PDAC desmoplasia may not be a simple physical barrier. Further exploration of this technology may improve our understanding of how specific stromal composition could impact T-cell activity, with potential impact on the optimization of immune-modulatory therapies.},

A mutation in the protein has been causally linked to Parkinson's disease in humans, and the normal protein is an abundant component of the intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) characteristic of the disease. {$\alpha$}-Synuclein is also the precursor to an intrinsic component of extracellular plaques in Alzheimer's disease. The {$\alpha$}-synuclein sequence is largely composed of degenerate 11-residue repeats reminiscent of the amphipathic {$\alpha$}-helical domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. We hypothesized that {$\alpha$}-synuclein should associate with phospholipid bilayers and that this lipid association should stabilize an {$\alpha$}-helical secondary structure in the protein. We report that {$\alpha$}-synuclein binds to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge. We further show that the protein associates preferentially with vesicles of smaller diameter (20\textendash 25 nm) as opposed to larger ({$\sim$}125 nm) vesicles. Lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in {$\alpha$}-helicity from 3\% to approximately 80\%. These observations are consistent with a role in vesicle function at the presynaptic terminal.},

  abstract = {We have used NMR spectroscopy and limited proteolysis to characterize the structural properties of the Parkinson's disease-related protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein in lipid and detergent micelle environments. We show that the lipid or micelle surface-bound portion of the molecule adopts a continuously helical structure with a single break. Modeling {$\alpha$}S as an ideal {$\alpha$}-helix reveals a hydrophobic surface that winds around the helix axis in a right-handed fashion. This feature is typical of 11-mer repeat containing sequences that adopt right-handed coiled coil conformations. In order to bind a flat or convex lipid surface, however, an unbroken helical {$\alpha$}S structure would need to adopt an unusual, slightly unwound, {$\alpha$}11/3 helix conformation (three complete turns per 11 residues). The break we observe in the {$\alpha$}S helix may allow the protein to avoid this unusual conformation by adopting two shorter stretches of typical {$\alpha$}-helical structure. However, a quantitative analysis suggests the possibility that the {$\alpha$}11/3 conformation may in fact exist in lipid-bound {$\alpha$}S. We discuss how structural features of helical 11-mer repeats could play a role in the reversible lipid binding function of {$\alpha$}-synuclein and generalize this argument to include the 11-mer repeat-containing apolipoproteins, which also require the ability to release readily from lipid surfaces. A search of protein sequence databases confirms that synuclein-like 11-mer repeats are present in other proteins that bind lipids reversibly and predicts such a role for a number of hypothetical proteins of unknown function.},

Mice that lack {$\alpha$}-synuclein have been generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Electron microscopic examination of hippocampal synapses revealed a striking selective deficiency of undocked vesicles without affecting docked vesicles. Field recording of CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from the mutant mice demonstrated normal basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, and response to a brief train of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 40 pulses) that exhausts only docked vesicles. In contrast, the {$\alpha$}-synuclein knock-out mice exhibited significant impairments in synaptic response to a prolonged train of repetitive stimulation (12.5 Hz, 300 pulses) capable of depleting docked as well as reserve pool vesicles. Moreover, the replenishment of the docked vesicles by reserve pool vesicles after depletion was slower in the mutant synapses. Thus, {$\alpha$}-synuclein may be required for the genesis and/or maintenance of a subset of presynaptic vesicles, those in the ``reserve'' or ``resting'' pools. These results reveal, for the first time, the normal function of endogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein in regulating synaptic vesicle mobilization at nerve terminals.},

Our aim is to provide guidance for urologists to help prioritize urological cancer surgeries. Materials and Methods: We reviewed published literature on bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, penile cancer, testis cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer and adrenal cancer. Results: For muscle invasive bladder cancer delays should be less than roughly 10 weeks and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered. Patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer should be counseled appropriately based on risk and intravesical therapies can continue. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma should also be treated with minimal delays for high risk patients, especially with ureteral tumors. Surgery for T1 renal cancers when indicated can be delayed until adequate resources are available. Patients with T2 renal cancer should be considered for early surgery if there are unfavorable preoperative characteristics. Higher stage renal tumors should be considered for early surgery. An early multidisciplinary approach is recommended for metastatic renal cancers. High risk prostate cancer may need preferential treatment and consideration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Penile cancer can have worse sexual or oncologic outcomes with prolonged surgical delay. Likewise, adrenal cancer is aggressive and needs early surgical treatment. Testicular cancer should be treated in a timely manner with surgery or chemotherapy, as indicated. Conclusions: This review should further assist urologists in recognizing patients with potentially aggressive tumor biology that warrants early treatment.},

  abstract = {Dopaminergic (DA) cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the gradual appearance of neuronal protein aggregates termed Lewy bodies (LBs) that are comprised of vesicular membrane structures and dysmorphic organelles in conjunction with the protein alpha-Synuclein ({$\alpha$}-Syn). Although the exact mechanism of neuronal aggregate formation and death remains elusive, recent research suggests {$\alpha$}-Syn-mediated alterations in the lysosomal degradation of aggregated proteins and organelles - a process termed autophagy. Here, we used a combination of molecular biology and immunochemistry to investigate the effect of {$\alpha$}-Syn on autophagy turnover in cultured human DA neurons and in human post-mortem brain tissue. We found {$\alpha$}-Syn overexpression to reduce autophagy turnover by compromising the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, thus leading to a decrease in the formation of autolysosomes. In accord with a compensatory increase in the plasma membrane fusion of autophagosomes, {$\alpha$}-Syn enhanced the number of extracellular vesicles (EV) and the abundance of autophagy-associated proteins in these EVs. Mechanistically, {$\alpha$}-Syn decreased the abundance of the v-SNARE protein SNAP29, a member of the SNARE complex mediating autophagolysosome fusion. In line, SNAP29 knockdown mimicked the effect of {$\alpha$}-Syn on autophagy whereas SNAP29 co-expression reversed the {$\alpha$}-Syn-induced changes on autophagy turnover and EV release and ameliorated DA neuronal cell death. In accord with our results from cultured neurons, we found a stage-dependent reduction of SNAP29 in SNc DA neurons from human post-mortem brain tissue of Lewy body pathology (LBP) cases. In summary, our results thus demonstrate a previously unknown effect of {$\alpha$}-Syn on intracellular autophagy-associated SNARE proteins and, as a consequence, a reduced autolysosome fusion. As such, our findings will therefore support the investigation of autophagy-associated pathological changes in PD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Data from randomized trials are lacking on the benefits and risks of initiating antiretroviral therapy in patients with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who have a CD4+ count of more than 350 cells per cubic millimeter. METHODS We randomly assigned HIV-positive adults who had a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter to start antiretroviral therapy immediately (immediate-initiation group) or to defer it until the CD4+ count decreased to 350 cells per cubic millimeter or until the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or another condition that dictated the use of antiretroviral therapy (deferred-initiation group). The primary composite end point was any serious AIDS-related event, serious non\textendash AIDS-related event, or death from any cause. RESULTS A total of 4685 patients were followed for a mean of 3.0 years. At study entry, the median HIV viral load was 12,759 copies per milliliter, and the median CD4+ count was 651 cells per cubic millimeter. On May 15, 2015, on the basis of an interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board determined that the study question had been answered and recommended that patients in the deferred-initiation group be offered antiretroviral therapy. The primary end point occurred in 42 patients in the immediate-initiation group (1.8\%; 0.60 events per 100 personyears), as compared with 96 patients in the deferred-initiation group (4.1\%; 1.38 events per 100 person-years), for a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.62; P{$<$}0.001). Hazard ratios for serious AIDS-related and serious non\textendash AIDS-related events were 0.28 (95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.50; P{$<$}0.001) and 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.97; P\,=\,0.04), respectively. More than two thirds of the primary end points (68\%) occurred in patients with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter. The risks of a grade 4 event were similar in the two groups, as were the risks of unscheduled hospital admissions. The members of the writing group (Jens D. Lundgren, M.D. [cochair], Abdel G.

  abstract = {Oligomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}S) is considered to be the potential toxic species responsible for the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease, possibly through the disruption of lipid membranes. Although there is evidence that oligomers contain considerable amounts of secondary structure, more detailed data on the structural characteristics and how these mediate oligomer\textendash lipid binding are critically lacking. This report is, to our knowledge, the first study that aimed to address the structure of oligomeric {$\alpha$}S on a more detailed level. We have used tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence spectroscopy to gain insight into the structural features of oligomeric {$\alpha$}S and the structural basis for oligomer\textendash lipid interactions. Several single Trp mutants of {$\alpha$}S were used to gain site-specific information about the microenvironments of monomeric {$\alpha$}S, oligomeric {$\alpha$}S and lipid-bound oligomeric {$\alpha$}S. Acrylamide quenching and spectral analyses indicate that the Trp residues are considerably more solvent protected in the oligomeric form compared with the monomeric protein. In the oligomers, the negatively charged C-terminus was the most solvent exposed part of the protein. Upon lipid binding, a blue shift in fluorescence was observed for {$\alpha$}S mutants where the Trp is located within the N-terminal region. These results suggest that, as in the case of monomeric {$\alpha$}S, the N-terminus is critical in determining oligomer\textendash lipid binding.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of aggregates (Lewy bodies) in neurons. alpha-Synuclein is the major protein in Lewy bodies and rare mutations in alpha-synuclein cause early-onset PD. Consequently, alpha-synuclein is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we have investigated the degradation pathways of alpha-synuclein, using a stable inducible PC12 cell model, where the expression of exogenous human wild-type, A30P, or A53T alpha-synuclein can be switched on and off. We have used a panel of inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy and proteasome function and followed alpha-synuclein degradation in these cells. We found that not only is alpha-synuclein degraded by the proteasome, but it is also degraded by autophagy. A role for autophagy was further supported by the presence of alpha-synuclein in organelles with the ultrastructural features of autophagic vesicles. Since rapamycin, a stimulator of autophagy, increased clearance of alpha-synuclein, it merits consideration as a potential therapeutic for Parkinsons disease, as it is designed for chronic use in humans.},

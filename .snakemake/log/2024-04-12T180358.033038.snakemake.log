MissingOutputException in rule gfp_deg_fluorometry in file /home/raphael/projects/diploma_thesis/snakefile, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
src/data/gfp_deg/processed/fluorometry/1/BradLab.xlsx (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
